<p class="abstract">
This paper introduces a new challenge for image similarity search in the context of
fashion, addressing the inherent ambiguity in this domain stemming from complex
images. We present Referred Visual Search (RVS), a task allowing users to define
more precisely the desired similarity, following recent interest in the industry. We
release a new large public dataset, LRVS-Fashion, consisting of 272k fashion
products with 842k images extracted from fashion catalogs, designed explicitly
for this task. However, unlike traditional visual search methods in the industry,
we demonstrate that superior performance can be achieved by bypassing explicit
object detection and adopting weakly-supervised conditional contrastive learning
on image tuples. Our method is lightweight and demonstrates robustness, reaching
Recall at one superior to strong detection-based baselines against 2M distractors.
